# README

`unicode-data-scripts` provides Haskell APIs to efficiently access the Unicode
character scripts from the
[Unicode character database](https://www.unicode.org/ucd/).

The Haskell data structures are generated programmatically from the
Unicode character database (UCD) files. The latest Unicode version
supported by this library is
[`14.0.0`](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode14.0.0/).

Please see the
[Haddock documentation](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/unicode-data-scripts)
